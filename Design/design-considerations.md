# Design Considerations

All communication between the On-Prem HW and HPE must be secure

Dark sites may not allow communication from On-Prem HW and HPE

Do multiple On-Prem HW sources each communicate with HPE or should we consider a collector unit. If we use a collector then we need to make sure it is HA.
